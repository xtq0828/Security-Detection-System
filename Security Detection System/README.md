capturing data packets on android &amp; data analysis

Before you download and use this software, you have to make sure that you can meet follow requirements in the related environmentï¼š
1.Install the WPF Toolkit successfully. Our group install the WPF Toolkit - February 2010 Release in this page--
http://wpf.codeplex.com/releases/view/40535/, and we cannot make sure that you can run our software with other versions, 
because we finished this project in 2013, and the WPF Toolkit might have changed a lot now. 
2.There are some files in our project might be named in Chinese, and it migh be a litte difficult for you to understand
our fuctions in the user interface, and this is a pity because our group members did not consider that there are some
foreign professors might be interested in reading our code...and the most useful advice I can give is reading the 
operation steps about what I did in this project in my CV and get to know the general purpose to be achieved in our project in my PS. It might be helpful to some extent.
Finally, I am glad to receive E-mail(my E-mail address is in my profile in github) and reply if you have any questions,
thank you.
